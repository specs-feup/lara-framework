# Potential Issues Found During Stage 3 (Events Subsystem)

While implementing tests for the events subsystem, I noticed documentation inconsistencies that can mislead users and contributors. These are not runtime failures, but they are bugs in Javadoc that should be corrected for clarity and to avoid confusion.

## 1) Stage name mismatch in `AGear` Javadoc
- Location: `src/org/lara/interpreter/weaver/interf/AGear.java`
- Snippet:
  - The Javadoc of both `onAction` and `onAttribute` says: "Method to execute when an action is executed ({@link Stage#BEGIN} and {@link Stage#AFTER})"
- Why it’s a bug:
  - The `Stage` enum has values `BEGIN`, `DURING`, and `END`. There is no `AFTER` stage. The intended value appears to be `END`.
- Suggested fix:
  - Replace `{@link Stage#AFTER}` with `{@link Stage#END}` in both method Javadocs.

## 2) Example stage name in `Stage.toCode()` Javadoc
- Location: `src/org/lara/interpreter/weaver/interf/events/Stage.java`
- Snippet:
  - The Javadoc says: "Returns a string representation of the stage, such as 'Stage.BEFORE'"
- Why it’s a bug:
  - There is no `BEFORE` stage in the enum. The equivalent is `BEGIN`.
- Suggested fix:
  - Replace `'Stage.BEFORE'` with `'Stage.BEGIN'` in the Javadoc example.

These issues don’t affect runtime behavior, but updating the comments will prevent confusion for developers reading the API docs or searching for a non-existent stage.
